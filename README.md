# Visualizations

The Visualizations repository contains samples of simple visualization projects I have worked on. Most of my visualizations rely upon 4 specific libraries:
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- jupyter-dash

As one might expect, I also do use pandas and numpy for handling data. Additionally, I use streamlit when I need to make webapps.

Below is a brief explanation of files found in this repository.
- ux-resops-test2021 - a jupyter-dash plotly dashboard based on a small subset of data modeled after data taken from a research tracking system I created at work. In particular, the data relates to my participant tracker.
